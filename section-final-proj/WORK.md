~~# Final project: Acceleration Pedal Position Simulator~~

## There is no final project this semester. 

In lieu of this, all sections are required.

This is subject to change in future semesters. Should a final project be required in the future, members who have already completed it prior to its addition will not be asked to complete it again.

Please ensure your fork is public and ready to be graded.
